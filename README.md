## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:

I started out very intimidated on how to approach building a website using HTML and CSS because it is not like a traditional language that I have used before. However through many iterations of creating my own website, I have built mikevarela.com and am beyond proud. This project has brought back the spark that I felt very early on in my coding journey. After completing this website, I am eager to tackle many more projects in the future!
